## Project Overview

Prompt Lab is a multi surface prompt engineering tool with extension, desktop, and web oriented shells. It focuses on authoring, saving, testing, comparing, and reusing prompts across multiple providers.

## Stack

- React
- Vite
- Chrome extension surface plus desktop and web shells
- Local storage and Chrome storage persistence
- Vitest for targeted tests

## Key Decisions

- Keep provider support abstracted so UI and execution flows are not hard wired to one model vendor
- Separate authoring, library, experiments, and notebook concerns even when they share one shell
- Persist prompt, run, and settings state locally to keep the tool fast and offline tolerant where possible

## Issue Tracker

| ID | Severity | Status | Title | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| 001 | P2 | resolved | Composer still teaches drag first interaction | Fixed all help text strings; empty state and block hints now lead with Add/Move controls |
| 002 | P2 | in-progress | Create workflow remains too vertically stacked | Layout is improved, but Create still carries too many stages in one scroll path |
| 003 | P2 | in-progress | Experiments and run history are still split | A B flow and run analysis are improved but not fully unified |
| 004 | P2 | resolved | Accessibility parity remains incomplete | Added aria-labels to theme/shortcuts/settings buttons; ThemeProvider now syncs body bg |
| 005 | P2 | resolved | Privacy policy page missing, all nav links dead | Created docs/privacy.html, fixed all nav/footer links to relative paths |
| 006 | P2 | resolved | No diff viewer for A/B test outputs | Added DiffEngine.js, DiffPane.jsx, and Sync View button in ABTestTab |
