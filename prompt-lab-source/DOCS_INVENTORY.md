# Prompt Lab Documentation Inventory

Updated: 2026-03-22

## Canonical Source Rules

- `../README.md` is the contributor entry point for the repo.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the canonical system architecture reference.
- `ROADMAP.md` is the canonical forward-looking product/runtime roadmap.
- `prompt-lab-extension/VERSION_HISTORY.md` is the canonical multi-surface changelog.
- `prompt-lab-web/index.html` is the authoring source for the public landing page.
- `prompt-lab-web/public/` is the preferred authoring source for auxiliary public HTML docs where a source copy exists.
- `../docs/` is the published public-docs/static-site copy, not the preferred authoring location.
- Root operational docs like `../CURRENT_PROJECT_REPORT.md` and `../SESSION_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` are working context artifacts, not canonical product docs.

## Historical but retained

| Path | Scope | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prompt-lab-extension/EXECUTION_PRD_V1.4.md` | Implementation planning | Historical | Keep for design context; not the source of truth for current behavior. |
| `prompt-lab-extension/BUG_PATCH_REPORT.md` | One-off remediation report | Historical | Useful for audit trail, but superseded by version history. |
| `../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Execution tracker | Historical | Useful release context, but not the canonical description of current system behavior. |
| `../V1.6.0_NOTES.md` | Version notes | Historical | Snapshot release notes; keep for context, not as a live product spec. |
| `_archive/DEPRECATED.md` | Archive marker | Historical | Indicates archived material under `_archive/`. |
| `_archive/PROPOSAL_V1.3.1.md` | Older proposal | Historical | Snapshot only; do not use for current architecture decisions. |
| `_archive/QA_LANDING_PAGE.md` | Earlier landing-page QA pack | Historical | Checklist from the older standalone marketing-site phase. |

## Legacy / duplicate docs

| Path | Scope | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `../prompt-lab-extension/README.md` | Older unpacked extension bundle | Legacy | Outside the canonical `prompt-lab-source/` tree. Leave untouched unless that duplicate tree is intentionally revived. |
| `public/prompt-lab-landing.html` | Legacy landing mirror | Legacy | Retained as a compatibility mirror; `prompt-lab-web/index.html` is the landing-page source of truth. |

## Maintenance notes

- Prefer updating authoring sources under `prompt-lab-source/` first, then sync the published copy under `../docs/` when relevant.
- Use `scripts/publish-landing.mjs` to sync public landing/docs files into `../docs/` without deleting unrelated repo-owned content such as `docs/app/` or internal trackers.
- When shared frontend behavior changes, update extension, web, and desktop docs together.
- When public URLs, repo slug, or deploy shape change, update:
  - `../README.md`
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `prompt-lab-web/README.md`
  - affected public HTML docs
- Treat stale `prompt-lab-provider-options` references and older GitHub Pages wording as drift bugs, not acceptable historical leftovers in active docs.
- Keep release docs aligned with the latest verified commands and current deploy shape.
