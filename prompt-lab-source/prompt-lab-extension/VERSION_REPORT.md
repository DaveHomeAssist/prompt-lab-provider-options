# Prompt Lab Version Report

- Date: 2026-03-13
- Release: `v1.5.0`
- Scope: extension runtime, shared frontend architecture, hosted web shell, desktop shell, CI, and packaging

## Release summary

`v1.5.0` is the first release where Prompt Lab is documented and maintained as a shared extension-plus-web-plus-desktop product instead of only an MV3 extension.

## Technical state

- Shared frontend source lives in `prompt-lab-extension/src/`.
- The Chrome extension packages that source into an MV3 side panel build.
- The hosted web deployment serves a landing page at `promptlab.tools/` and the shared app at `https://prompt-lab-tawny.vercel.app/app/`.
- The Tauri desktop app loads the same `main.jsx` entry through `prompt-lab-desktop/index.html`.
- Supported providers are Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, and Ollama.

## Notable changes in this release

- Added hook-level coverage for `useTestCases` and `useEvalRuns`.
- Consolidated PII detection and redaction logic into `src/lib/piiEngine.js`.
- Introduced provider abstraction modules for background-side provider dispatch.
- Added a Playwright smoke test for the extension enhance flow.
- Added extension CI and desktop cross-platform CI workflows.
- Added a desktop in-app settings modal with localStorage-backed provider settings.
- Cleaned up desktop packaging inputs for macOS bundle generation.
